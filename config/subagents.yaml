    If the current location of residence is not available, you may use the location of the venue
    where they publish as a best guess.
    For each piece of information, provide evidence in the form of a link to the webpage where you found it,
    and a brief excerpt from the webpage that supports your finding.
    You may use ONLY the following URL to find this information: {{ bio_url }}.
